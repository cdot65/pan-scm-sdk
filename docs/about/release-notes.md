code linters do not flag these lines, allowing tests to run without interruptions or false positives. The integrity of
the mocked data for test validation remains unchanged.

## Version 0.2.0

**Release Date:** November 4th

### Updates:

* Add fetch method to various profile and object classes

Implemented a `fetch` method in multiple profile and object classes to retrieve single resources by name. The method
includes validation to ensure exactly one container type is provided and integrates additional filters for detailed
querying.

* Refactor update methods to use data['id'] directly

Updated the `update` methods across various classes to derive the endpoint using `data['id']` instead of passing
`object_id` explicitly. This change optimizes the update process and standardizes the method signatures.

* Simplify update method signatures and improve error handling

Modified the update methods across multiple security profile classes to remove the `object_id` parameter and use the '
id' from the data dictionary instead. Enhanced the DecryptionProfile class with improved error handling and checks for
consistent and clear update operations.

* Refactor update method to use 'id' from data dictionary

The update method now constructs the endpoint URL using the 'id' field from the input data dictionary instead of a
separate object_id parameter. This change simplifies the method signature and makes it more consistent with the rest of
the codebase.

* Add AntiSpywareProfileUpdateModel to anti_spyware_profiles

Add a new model, AntiSpywareProfileUpdateModel, for handling updates to anti-spyware profiles. This includes fields for
profile ID, folder, snippet, device, rules, and threat exceptions. This change facilitates more comprehensive API
requests related to anti-spyware profiles.

* Refine error type extraction logic in client.py

Updated the error type extraction to handle cases where 'details' can be either a dict or a list. This ensures proper
concatenation of error messages when 'details' is a list and improves overall error handling robustness.

* Refactor address group response handling

Revised the handling of API responses for address group lookups to cater to both single-object and list formats. Added
specific error handling for cases where no or multiple address groups are found, improving robustness and error
transparency. Included additional exceptions for more detailed error reporting.

* Refactor address group response handling

Revised the handling of API responses for address group lookups to cater to both single-object and list formats. Added
specific error handling for cases where no or multiple address groups are found, improving robustness and error
transparency. Included additional exceptions for more detailed error reporting.

and its subclasses with additional attributes and methods like `from_error_response`. Added `ErrorHandler` for mapping
error responses to appropriate exception classes and included new exceptions for specific cases.

* Validate presence of exactly one address type

Add docstrings to clarify that the validators ensure exactly one of the fields 'ip_netmask', 'ip_range', 'ip_wildcard',
or 'fqdn' is provided. Refine the validation logic to explicitly handle cases where no field or more than one field is
provided.

* Add new Address factories for various address models

Introduce new factories: AddressCreateIpNetmaskFactory, AddressCreateFqdnFactory, AddressCreateIpRangeFactory, and
AddressCreateIpWildcardFactory to support various AddressCreateModel instances. Update imports and adjust existing
factory classes to align with the new AddressCreateModel instead of AddressRequestModel.

* Enhance address handling and testing in SCM

Extend address functions to cover various types like `ip-netmask`, `fqdn`, `ip-range`, and `ip-wildcard`. Added
comprehensive test cases for CRUD operations, including validations and error handling, and enhanced mock responses to
ensure realistic API simulations.

* Add detailed exception handling for API-specific errors

Enhanced the error handling in `scm/client.py` to include specific exceptions like `ObjectNotPresentError`,
`FolderNotFoundError`, `MalformedRequestError`, and `EmptyFieldError`. Updated the `_handle_api_error` method to first
address API-specific error codes before falling back to status code-based handling.

* Move test_addresses.py to scm/config directory

This change reorganizes the test file structure for better modularity. The test_addresses.py file is now located in the
scm/config directory to match the updated project layout.

The unnecessary `else` clause setting `error_type` to an empty string has been removed, as it doesn't affect the
existing logic. This simplifies the code and makes it easier to maintain.

* Relocate test_address_groups.py to new directory

Moved test_address_groups.py to scm/config to better organize tests by their context and group related files together.
This enhances maintainability and readability of the test suite.
