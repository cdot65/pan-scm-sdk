## Folder Organization

Folders are used to organize resources in a hierarchical structure in the Strata Cloud Manager. They form the foundation
of resource organization and provide the following benefits:

- Logical organization of resources by function, team, or purpose
- Hierarchical navigation through nested folder structures
- Inheritance of policies and configurations from parent folders
- Simplified management of resource permissions

See the [Folder](folder.md) documentation for detailed information on working with folder objects.
