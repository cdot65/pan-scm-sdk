# Setup Data Models

## Overview

The Setup models provide structured data representations for resources related to organization and environment setup in
Palo Alto Networks' Strata Cloud Manager. These models are used to validate, serialize, and deserialize data for API
operations.

## Working with Setup Models

Setup models provide a structured way to interact with the Strata Cloud Manager API. They ensure data validation before
requests are sent and proper parsing of API responses.
