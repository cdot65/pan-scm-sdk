## Approach

1. **Automatic Fixes**: Used `poetry run ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes` to automatically fix:
   - D200 errors (118 fixed)
   - D415 errors (48 fixed)

2. **Manual Fixes**: Had to manually fix:
   - Module and package docstrings
   - Class and function docstrings
   - Meta class docstrings in factory files
   - Multi-line docstrings requiring blank lines (D205)
   - Special methods like `__init__`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`

3. **Batch Operations**: Used the Batch tool to efficiently update similar files

## Final Status
- All ruff checks passing: `poetry run ruff check .`
- All quality checks passing: `make quality`
- All tests passing with 100% coverage: `make test-cov`
- Total files modified: ~130 files across tests/ and examples/ directories

## Key Learnings
- Most docstring errors require manual fixes
- `--unsafe-fixes` can handle some formatting issues automatically
- Factory Meta classes require special attention
- Multi-line docstrings need proper blank line formatting
- Batch processing is essential for large-scale fixes
